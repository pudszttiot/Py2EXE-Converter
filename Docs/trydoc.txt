# Py2EXE Converter

This is a Python program to convert a Python script into an executable (.exe) file using PyInstaller.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing `python py2exe_converter.py` in the command line or by double-clicking the file in your file explorer.
2. Select a Python script to convert by clicking "Browse for Python file" and selecting the file.
3. (Optional) Select an icon (.ico) file for your executable by clicking "Browse for Icon" and selecting the file.
4. Enter a name for your executable in the "Enter application name" field.
5. Select an output folder where the executable will be saved by clicking "Browse for Output Folder" and selecting a directory.
6. Choose any desired PyInstaller options by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
7. Click "Convert" to create the executable file.

## How it works

The program uses PyInstaller to package the Python script and its dependencies into a single executable file. The following PyInstaller options are available:

- `--onefile`: Packages everything into a single file
- `--windowed`: Hides the console when the executable is run
- `--noconsole`: Prevents the console from opening

The program also allows you to specify an icon file to use for the executable and to name the output file.
